# Frame-By-Frame Live Animation - P5js
These sketches show some ways of creating interactive or code-driven animations with a limited set of existing frames.

Plays a random outcome to the sequence each time it loops.

There's 40 frames total:
- 16 intro frames show the ball coming in, and then being thrown up the ramp until it hits the back wall.
- After that, each set of 6 frames shows a different outcome (♠,♥,♦,♣).

The program randomly selects an outcome before it plays each time. Depending on that outcome, the frames for it are played to interupt the intro sequence at the right time. 
Sometimes the ball bounces ooff the back wall and "falls back down" before playing the outcome.

This program just goes back and forth along a sequence of frames, following a noise function.

Takes 12 loops and plays a diifferent one for each hour. This one resets at 7am/pm.

A scattered array of line expressions with orderly access. 
Hover cursor to interact. 
Click or tap and drag to draw a line. 

This takes a single image of dots lines varying in length, as well as a set of points defining all those dots and lines.

The program animates two points interacting with the cursor, and then displays a line from the image - choosing one that's close the distance it's trying to render.
